## What is frontrunning bot?
  A frontrunning bot specialized in automated market making (AMM) takes advantage of price fluctuations observed in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that utilize the AMM model, such as Uniswap or PancakeSwap. By leveraging advanced algorithms, this bot actively monitors the network for impending trades and assesses the potential market impact of these trades. It strategically positions itself to capitalize on the price changes resulting from the original trades by executing its own trades before the initial orders are processed. The bot achieves this by analyzing the mempool, which comprises unconfirmed transactions awaiting inclusion in the blockchain. Through careful examination of the mempool and price movements, the bot predicts the price shifts that will occur upon trade execution, enabling it to execute profitable trades. AMM frontrunning bots prove particularly effective in DEXs with limited liquidity, as substantial trades can significantly impact the market, leading to exploitable price changes.

## Features
- **Multiple networks**: The bot can iteract with Uniswap-V3, SushiSwap, PancackeSwap and TraderJoe.
- **Mempool Monitoring**: The bot continuously monitors the mempool of the network, providing up-to-date information on pending transactions.
- **Transaction Analysis**: The bot analyzes pending transactions in the mempool, providing insights into transaction fees, gas prices, and other relevant metrics.
- **Profit transaction**: The bot performs transactions for most relevant pairs with low liquidity.

3. Make shure that firewall does not blocks any connections.

## Usage
1. Open 
Once the Mempool Monitoring Bot is up and running, it will start monitoring the mempool of the specified blockchain network. Here are some examples of how to use the bot:

1. **Configuring Notifications**: Use the bot's interface or configuration file to set up notifications based on specific conditions, such as high transaction fees or low pending transactions.

2. **Monitoring Mempool Data**: Access the bot's interface or API endpoints to view real-time mempool data, including pending transactions, gas prices, and other relevant metrics.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md).
